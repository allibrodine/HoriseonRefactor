# Project Horiseon Refactor
An exercise in cleaning up code.


## Description
Using starter code
* semantic html elements were added
* html structure was organized 
* alt attributes were given to images
* heading elements fall in sequential order 
* the title element was given more descriptive text
* the CSS file was edited to accomodate new element names and elements with the same properties were combined into the same CSS rules 
* all edits were made without changing the look of the webpage
